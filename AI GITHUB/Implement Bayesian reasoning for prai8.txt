Implement Bayesian reasoning for probabilistic inference for Weather prediction.

Procedure: 
1. Install SWI-Prolog: Ensure that SWI-Prolog is installed on your system. 
2. Create a Prolog file: Open a text editor and save the file with a .pl extension, e.g., 
weather_prediction.pl. 
3. Define Prior Probabilities: Assign prior probabilities to different weather conditions. 
4. Define Conditional Probabilities: Use conditional probabilities to model the 
relationship between observed evidence (e.g., clouds, humidity) and weather 
conditions. 
5. Implement Bayesian Inference: Use Prolog rules to compute posterior probabilities 
based on evidence. 
6. Query the System: Use Prolog queries to test the weather prediction system.


% Prior probabilities for weather conditions
prior(sunny, 0.5).
prior(rainy, 0.3).
prior(cloudy, 0.2).

% Conditional probabilities of evidence given weather condition
probability(cloudy_given_sunny, 0.2).
probability(cloudy_given_rainy, 0.7).
probability(cloudy_given_cloudy, 0.9).

probability(humidity_given_sunny, 0.3).
probability(humidity_given_rainy, 0.8).
probability(humidity_given_cloudy, 0.6).

% Bayesian inference for weather prediction
bayes(Weather, Evidence, Posterior) :-
prior(Weather, Prior),
    probability(Evidence, GivenProb),
    Posterior is Prior * GivenProb.

% Automatically run the query to display the posterior probability
:- initialization(run_sample_query).

% Run the sample query when the file is loaded
run_sample_query :-
    bayes(sunny, cloudy_given_sunny, P),
    write('Posterior Probability: '), write(P), nl.
