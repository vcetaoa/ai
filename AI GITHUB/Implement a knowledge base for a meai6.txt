Implement a knowledge base for a medical diagnosis system using Prolog.


% Facts defining diseases and their symptoms
symptom(flu, fever).
symptom(flu, cough).
symptom(flu, headache).
symptom(common_cold, sneezing).
symptom(common_cold, runny_nose).
symptom(common_cold, sore_throat).
symptom(covid_19, fever).
symptom(covid_19, cough).
symptom(covid_19, loss_of_taste).

% Rule to diagnose disease based on symptoms
diagnose(Disease) :-
    symptom(Disease, Symptom1),
    symptom(Disease, Symptom2),
    Symptom1 \= Symptom2, % Ensure the symptoms are distinct
    write('The patient may have '), write(Disease), nl.

% Rule to check for multiple diagnoses based on symptoms
diagnose_multiple :-
    diagnose(Disease),
    fail.  % Forces Prolog to backtrack and find all possible solutions
diagnose_multiple.  % Stops when no more diseases can be found

% Initialization goal to execute the diagnosis
:- initialization(diagnose_multiple).
