#Algo 

# Algorithm Used: Recursive Backtracking
# This is the classic recursive solution for Tower of Hanoi with:
# Time Complexity: O(2ⁿ) (exponential)
# Space Complexity: O(n) (due to recursion stack)

# Why This Approach?
# Minimal Moves: Always solves in 2ⁿ - 1 moves (optimal)
# Clear Logic: Demonstrates divide-and-conquer recursion
# Pedagogical: Classic example for teaching recursion
